lipiMap is a package for analyzing lipidomics data using a biologically-informed variational autoencoder (VAE) to construct interpretable latent space representations of lipidomics data. 
The package is designed to provide insights into the functional landscape of lipids by distilling high-dimensional data into interpretable lipid programs (LPs). 
LPs are groups of lipids that function as biological modules within lipid metabolism. 
They aim to simplify the understanding of lipid metabolism, a complex network of biochemical processes involving the synthesis, breakdown, and regulation of lipids.
